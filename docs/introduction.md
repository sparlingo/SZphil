This is the website for the Shenzhen Philosophy group

All the documents here are free to use for any purpose that you wish. We wish to be a reasonable group
of people who look at topics in insightful ways.

## Our Mission Statement
All that stuff that we wrote, put it in here please

## Our Saturday Meeting

We host an weekly discussion group where a speaker presents a topic that they have prepared with an 
emphasis on open discussion.
