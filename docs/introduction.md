This is the website for the Shenzhen Philosophy group

All the documents here are free to use for any purpose that you wish. We wish to be a reasonable group

## Our Mission Statement
All that stuff that we wrote, put it in here please

## Our Saturday Meeting

We host an weekly discussion group where a speaker presents a topic that they have prepared with an 
emphasis on open discussion. The meeting is integral to the mission of the group as the conversation should be shaped around preparing for, and responding to what is offered in the weekly meeting.

Currently the meeting place is [The Brew](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=63399e59-2e22-44df-994d-50f1e491503d&cp=22.535042~114.058921&lvl=17&imgid=743422e5-ee95-42c9-afd4-f1e0283600f8&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027), Saturdays @ 2:00 PM
